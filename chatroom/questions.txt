1) What is a socket?
communicate with other host

2) What is the difference between the domains AF_INET and AF_UNIX?
former is with remote host,latter is local

3) What is the difference between SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM?
STREAM is in TCP and DGDRAM is in UDP

4) Why is it important to clear all the values the addrinfo struct before using it in getaddrinfo?
	because none null value have specific meaning

5) What are ai_family and ai_socktype?
specify the socket type and IP type(desired address family)

6) What does getaddrinfo do?
getaddrinfo() returns one or more addrinfo structures, each
       of which contains an Internet address that can be specified in a call
       to bind(2) or connect(2)

7) What does connect do?
	       The connect() system call connects the socket referred to by the file
       descriptor sockfd to the address specified by addr.  The addrlen
       argument specifies the size of addr.

8) What is setsockopt?
The setsockopt() function shall set the option specified by the option_name argument, at the protocol level specified by the level argument, to the value pointed to by the option_value argument for the socket associated with the file descriptor specified by the socket argument.

9) What does bind do?
 When a socket is created with socket(2), it exists in a name space
       (address family) but has no address assigned to it.  bind() assigns
       the address specified by addr to the socket referred to by the file
       descriptor sockfd.  addrlen specifies the size, in bytes, of the
       address structure pointed to by addr.  Traditionally, this operation
       is called “assigning a name to a socket”.

10) What does listen do?
  listen() marks the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket,
       that is, as a socket that will be used to accept incoming connection
       requests using accept(2).

11) What does accept do?
 The accept() system call is used with connection-based socket types
       (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).  It extracts the first connection
       request on the queue of pending connections for the listening socket,
       sockfd, creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file
       descriptor referring to that socket.  The newly created socket is not
       in the listening state.  The original socket sockfd is unaffected by
       this call.
